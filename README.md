# The MultiBody State Estimation (MBSE) C++ library
A library for multibody forward and inverse dynamics, state estimation, and
parameter identification.

  * [C++ API docs](https://libmbse.readthedocs.io/).
  * [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MBDS/multibody-state-estimation).
  * [Applications](https://libmbse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pageApps.html).

## Paradigm #1: Based on factor-graphs
Forward and inverse dynamics, closed kinematic chains constraints solved as
factors in a factor graphs, and more.

## Paradigm #2: Particle filter estimator
A Bayesian filter has been implemented as a particle filter.
Only planar dynamics models have been tested.

## Compiling
Dependencies:
  * A C++ compiler
  * CMake
  * SuiteSparse
  * [MRPT](https://github.com/mrpt/mrpt/) (>=2.0.0)
    * Ubuntu: Use [this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~joseluisblancoc/+archive/ubuntu/mrpt)
  * [GTSAM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam) >=4.2
    * Ubuntu: Use [this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~borglab/+archive/ubuntu/gtsam-release-4.1)

In Ubuntu, install dependencies with:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsuitesparse-dev libmrpt-dev libgtsam-dev

To build:

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..  
        # If you see no errors, go on, otherwise fix them!
        make        # To compile the library and examples
        make test_legacy   # To run unit tests

You should also be able to compile this project under Windows and Visual Studio.

## GTSAM versions

For GTSAM <=4.2, use the `master` branch of this project.
For GTSAM >=4.3 (or their `develop` branch), use branch `newer-gtsam`.

## Using mbse as a library in a user program

In your CMake project, add:

        find_package(mbse REQUIRED)
        # then in your target:
        target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} mbse::mbse)

For CMake to find the library, in `cmake-gui` or `ccmake`, set the variable `mbse_DIR` to
`BUILD_DIR/cmake`, where `BUILD_DIR` is the compilation directory where you built MBSE.
